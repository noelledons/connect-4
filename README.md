# Connect 4 Game

Connect 4 is a game in which two players take turns dropping (coloured) discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertical grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The player who is able to place 4 of their coloured disks in one row (either horizontally or vertically) wins!
